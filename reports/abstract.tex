Mann~\cite{mann2008sparsest} proposed a method of identifying the hierarchical community structure of a graph, called the \emph{MCF cut algorithm}. It iteratively solves the maximum concurrent flow problem (MCFP)~\cite{matula1985concurrent} to identify a sequence of sparsest cuts. The aims of this work are to explore the stability of the clustering and to contextualize this method by comparison to other clustering techniques in the literature.
