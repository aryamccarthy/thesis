Many people know Jack Handey from his time dispensing wisdom from the hallowed halls of Saturday Night Live.  Beyond these brief glimpses afforded to late-night viewers, Handey shaped the field of Greatness through his academic works published over the last two decades.  Examining the themes of these works and their evolution over time provides a window into the state of our society â€“ what was great, and what could be even greater.
 
This dissertation analyzes three of Handey's most popular works, and asserts that greatness has not diminished over time as some have claimed, but merely has shifted to a new paradigm.
