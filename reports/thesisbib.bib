@article{girvan2002community,
	Abstract = {A number of recent studies have focused on the statistical   properties of networked systems such as social networks and the Worldwide     Web. Researchers have concentrated particularly on a few properties that    seem to be common to many networks: the small-world property, power-law    degree distributions, and network transitivity. In this article, we    highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of     community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly  knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a   method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using     centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on  computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is    already known and find that the method detects this known structure with   high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks    whose community structure is not well known---a collaboration network and a  food web---and find that it detects significant and informative community  divisions in both cases.},
