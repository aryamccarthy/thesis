\section{Introdution} \label{sec:insularity introduction} % Must have a blank line after every section label

Insularity is computed from the LP in a manner similar to Mann's computation of flowthrough centrality; however, it is a dynamic property of the network: a function of the network's utilization. 

Flowthrough centrality is computed by solving the HMCFP to the point of total saturation; it is related to the node's the node's capacity (its weighted degree, a property of the graph) and the amount of flow terminating at that point, which is given in the solution of the HMCFP.
