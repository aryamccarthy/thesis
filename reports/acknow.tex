I would like to thank everyone who gave me guidance over this thesis: my advisor, David Matula; Eli Olinick; Daniel Engels; Eric Larson; and Monnie McGee.

Additional appreciation goes to Eli Olinick for providing the leximin method implementation; Stejara Dinulescu for producing insightful visualizations; Robert Kalescky of SMU's Center for Scientific Computation for assisting me with SMU's \say{Maneframe} supercomputing cluster; Zizhen Chen, Ajinkya Rao, and Fernando Vilas for fruitful discussions; and Zhao Yang for providing datasets.

Further, I extend thanks to the faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Mathematics at SMU, especially Beth Minton, the CSE department's coordinator and secret lifeblood.

I'm also forever grateful to my family for being so patient with me and my friends for reminding me to take breaks and go be great instead of just reading about graph theory all of the time.
