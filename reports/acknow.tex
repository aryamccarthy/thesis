This work could not have been accomplished by the wisdom of my wonderful advisor, Prof. Rogers, along with his many colleagues in the Department of Greatness here at SMU.  I'm also forever grateful to my family for being so patient with me and my friends for reminding me to take breaks and go be great instead of just reading about greatness all of the time.
