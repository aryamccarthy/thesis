I would like to thank everyone who gave me guidance over this thesis, including but not limited to David Matula, Eli Olinick, Daniel Engels, and Monnie McGee.

Additional appreciation goes to Eli Olinick for providing an implementation of the MCF cut algorithm, Zizhen Chen for producing insightful visualizations, and Zhao Yang for providing datasets.

Further, I extend thanks to the faculty and staff of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering and the Department of Mathematics at SMU.

I'm also forever grateful to my family for being so patient with me and my friends for reminding me to take breaks and go be great instead of just reading about graph theory all of the time.
